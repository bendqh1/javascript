Image stored on the cloud was not loaded from here:

But, it did load from here:

```
<img class="jcb_phone_icon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Phone_icon.png" />
```

The first URL is the URL of a webpage, not of an image file, perhaps because `File:` component.

Not always a URL is to an image, even if it seems it is.
